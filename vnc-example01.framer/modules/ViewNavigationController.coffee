# TODO:
# Ignore all events not part of children to @current (avoid click through)
# Add custom animationOptions to .back()?
# Add "moveOut" animations? what's the use case? covered by back?
# If no need for moveOut, maybe we wont need consistent "In" naming scheme
# test use case with ios native push messages
# add pages when trying to animate them. eg. if @subLayers.indexOf(view) is -1 then @add view
